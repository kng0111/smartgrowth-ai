# Our Security Best Practices
To ensure the security of our project, we adhere to the following best practices:

## API Key Management:
All API keys, secrets, and sensitive credentials are not hardcoded in the codebase. They are stored securely using environment variables and are never committed to our public repository.

## Principle of Least Privilege:
We grant access to systems and data only to those who absolutely need it to perform their job. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.

## Dependency Management:
We regularly audit our project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and keep all third-party libraries updated.

## Data Protection:
We encrypt sensitive user data both at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols.

#@ Code Reviews: 
All code changes are reviewed by at least one other team member to identify potential security flaws before the code is merged.

## Public Disclosure
Once a vulnerability has been patched, we will publicly disclose the details to the community. This ensures transparency and helps other developers learn from the issue. We will credit the person who reported the vulnerability, unless they wish to remain anonymous.

Thank you for helping us keep SmartGrowth-AI secure.
